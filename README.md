The Edamam API is also used to get the nutritional information of each recipe to be displayed to the user. 
Recipes that they like can be saved to their list of recipes. 
Recipes in the saved list can be removed if the user changes their mind.
Once the user is satisfied with the saved recipes, they can generate a grocery list for these recipes.
